# App Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the top-level page with role routing and wallet integration for the BaseFam smart family wallet application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Next.js App Router Structure

Created a complete Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with Wagmi, OnchainKit, and React Query providers
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page with wallet connection and role-based routing
- `app/components/` - Reusable components for different user roles
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles and animations

### 2. Wallet Connection & Network Guard

#### Connect Wallet CTA
- Shows a branded welcome screen for disconnected users
- Uses Coinbase OnchainKit Wallet component for connection
- Supports MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet connectors
- Configured via existing `wagmi.config.ts`

#### Network Guard
- Enforces Base Sepolia network (chain ID: 84532)
- Shows warning screen if connected to wrong network
- Provides "Switch to Base Sepolia" button
- Uses wagmi's `useSwitchChain` hook for seamless network switching

#### Access Gating
- All features gated behind wallet connection
- Progressive disclosure: connect → verify network → detect role → show UI

### 3. Role Detection System

#### Automatic Role Detection
Queries the FamilyManager contract to determine user role:

1. **Child Detection**: Calls `isRegisteredChild(address)`
   - Returns `true` if address is registered as a child
   - Child role takes precedence if detected

2. **Parent Detection**: Calls `parentToChildren(address, 0)`
   - Returns first child address if user is a parent
   - Checks if result is not zero address

3. **Unknown Role**: Neither parent nor child
   - Shows helpful message about registration
   - Can be extended with registration flow

#### Manual Override (Development Only)
- Toggle buttons to override detected role
- Three modes: Auto-detect, Parent, Child
- Only visible when `NODE_ENV === "development"`
- Useful for testing different UI states without contract interaction

### 4. Role-Based Rendering

#### Parent Dashboard (`components/ParentDashboard.tsx`)
Features for parent accounts:
- Statistics cards (balance, active children, total spent)
- List of registered children with:
  - Child address display
  - Spending limits (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Active/Paused status
- Quick action buttons:
  - Register Child
  - Fund Children
  - Settings

Queries used:
- `parentToChildren(address, 0-2)` - Get children addresses
- `getChildLimits(address)` - Get child spending limits
- `isChildPaused(address)` - Check pause status

#### Child View (`components/ChildView.tsx`)
Features for child accounts:
- Warning banner if account is paused
- Balance display
- Parent account information
- Spending limits visualization:
  - Daily, weekly, monthly limits
  - Progress bars (ready for spent amount integration)
  - Visual indicators with icons
- Quick action buttons:
  - Request Funds
  - View History

Queries used:
- `getChildParent(address)` - Get parent address
- `getChildLimits(address)` - Get spending limits
- `isChildPaused(address)` - Check pause status

#### Transaction List (`components/TxList.tsx`)
- Collapsible transaction history
- Shows transaction details (from, to, value, status)
- Empty state with helpful message
- Expandable/collapsible design
- Ready for integration with real transaction data

### 5. State Management

#### Loading States
- Initial connection loading
- Network verification loading
- Role detection loading with spinner
- Contract query loading states

#### Error States
- Network mismatch handling
- Contract query failures
- Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- Retry functionality where appropriate

#### Disconnected Flow
- Shows branded welcome screen
- Clear call-to-action to connect wallet
- Maintains state when reconnecting
- Cleans up on disconnect

### 6. Global Notifications

Created a notification system (`components/Notifications.tsx`):
- Three types: success, error, info
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Animated slide-in from right
- Stacked display for multiple notifications
- Used throughout the app for user feedback

## Technical Details

### Configuration Files Created

1. **package.json** - Root dependencies and scripts
   - Next.js 14.2.0
   - React 19.2.0
   - Wagmi 2.12.0
   - Viem 2.21.0
   - @coinbase/onchainkit 0.33.0
   - @tanstack/react-query 5.56.0
   - Tailwind CSS 3.4.0

2. **next.config.js** - Next.js configuration
   - Webpack configuration for wallet libraries
   - External module handling

3. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration
   - ES2020 target
   - Strict mode enabled
   - Path aliases configured

4. **tailwind.config.js** - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - Custom color scheme (base-blue, etc.)
   - Content paths for app directory

5. **postcss.config.js** - PostCSS configuration
   - Tailwind CSS plugin
   - Autoprefixer plugin

6. **.env.example** - Environment variable template
   - Required API keys documented
   - Contract address placeholder

### Providers Setup

The `app/layout.tsx` sets up the provider hierarchy:
```
WagmiProvider
  └─ QueryClientProvider
      └─ OnchainKitProvider
          └─ Page Content
```

This provides:
- Blockchain connection (Wagmi)
- Query caching (React Query)
- Wallet UI and utilities (OnchainKit)

### Contract Integration

Uses wagmi hooks for all contract interactions:
- `useAccount()` - Get connected wallet info
- `useReadContract()` - Read contract state
- `useSwitchChain()` - Switch network

All contract calls reference the FamilyManager ABI from `contract/abis.ts`.

## User Flows

### First-Time User Flow
1. User lands on page
2. Sees branded welcome screen with "Connect Wallet" button
3. Clicks connect, selects wallet (MetaMask or Coinbase)
4. If wrong network, sees network switch prompt
5. Clicks "Switch to Base Sepolia"
6. App detects role from contract
7. Shows appropriate dashboard (Parent/Child/Unknown)

### Parent User Flow
1. Sees parent dashboard with children overview
2. Views statistics (balance, children count, spending)
3. Sees list of registered children with limits
4. Can click actions to manage family wallet
5. Views transaction history at bottom

### Child User Flow
1. Sees child view with balance and limits
2. If paused, sees warning banner
3. Views spending limits with progress bars
4. Sees parent account information
5. Can request funds or view history
6. Views transaction history at bottom

### Development Testing Flow
1. Developer enables role override toggle
2. Switches between parent/child views
3. Tests UI states without contract interaction
4. Validates component behavior

## Responsive Design

All components are responsive:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm, md, lg
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Readable text on all devices

## Styling System

### Tailwind Configuration
Custom colors defined:
- `base-blue` (#0052FF) - Primary brand color
- `base-blue-dark` (#0041CC) - Hover states
- `light-bg` (#F5F8FA) - Background color
- `light-text` (#6B7280) - Secondary text
- `dark-text` (#1F2937) - Primary text

### Custom Animations
Defined in `globals.css`:
- `slide-in-right` - For notifications
- Smooth transitions throughout

### Component Patterns
- Cards with rounded corners and shadows
- Gradient backgrounds for statistics
- Icon integration with Heroicons
- Consistent spacing and padding

## Security Considerations

1. **Client-Side Only**: All code runs client-side, no server-side secrets
2. **Environment Variables**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client variables
3. **Read-Only Operations**: Current implementation only reads from contract
4. **Network Validation**: Enforces correct network before any operations
5. **Address Validation**: Checks for zero addresses in contract responses

## Future Enhancements

Ready for extension with:
- [ ] Write operations (register child, fund, update limits)
- [ ] Real transaction history from blockchain events
- [ ] Balance display from contract or RPC
- [ ] Spending analytics and charts
- [ ] Real-time updates with WebSocket
- [ ] Push notifications for transactions
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with actual values
   ```

3. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Test flows**:
   - Try connecting wallet
   - Test network switching
   - Use role override in development
   - Check responsive design

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Set production environment variables

3. Deploy to hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

4. Verify contract address is correct for production

## Integration with Existing Code
